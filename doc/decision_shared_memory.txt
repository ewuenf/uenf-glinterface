Initially the design contained the possibility to use a shared memory 
segment for communication to a render backend on a global server such
that all data structures including vertex data etc would be exported
to the server and all other authorized programs (read-only in this case)
without any rendering performed on the client side. This would have
enabled the server to perform interesting effects with the geometry 
etc. The downside proved to be the much more complicated and limited
implementation options that come with the lack of pointers in
shared memory and additionally the extra effort correlated to the
access control to these segments (read-write for the server, read-only
to other selected processes of the same user)
